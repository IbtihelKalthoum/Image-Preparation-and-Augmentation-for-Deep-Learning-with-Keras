# 🎨 Image-Preparation-and-Augmentation-for-Deep-Learning-with-Keras 🖼️

Dive into the rich arena of image preparation and augmentation tailored for deep learning using Keras, an eminent open-source, high-level Neural Network library. This repository provides a deep dive into a plethora of image augmentation techniques pivotal for enhancing the performance of deep learning models.

## 🚀 Getting Started:

### 1. **Installation and Setup**:

Before diving into the marvels of Keras, it's vital to set up its underlying platform: TensorFlow.
    
    - Install TensorFlow.
    - Set up Keras environment.

### 2. **Keras Image Augmentation API**:

Keras simplifies image augmentation with the `ImageDataGenerator` class, a swiss knife for image data preparation.

- **Horizontal and Vertical Shift Augmentation**: Shift images either vertically or horizontally.
  
- **Horizontal and Vertical Flip Augmentation**: Flip images for a mirror-like transformation.
  
- **Random Rotation Augmentation**: Add randomness with unpredictable rotations ranging from 0 to 360 degrees.
  
- **Random Brightness Augmentation**: Randomly alter the image brightness, offering a spectrum between darkening and brightening.
  
- **Random Zoom Augmentation**: Zoom in or out of images, giving a closer or broader perspective.

### 3. **Applications on MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset**:

Explore the application of these techniques on the classic MNIST dataset.

- **Feature Standardization**: Standardize pixel values for consistent image input.
  
- **Image Whitening**: Reduce redundancy in images to accentuate structures and features, enabling the algorithm to learn better.
  
- **Random Rotations, Shifts, and Flips**: Dive deeper with random manipulations.
  
- **Saving Augmented Images**: Save your transformed images for future use or analysis.
